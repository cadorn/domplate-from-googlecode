NOTE: This project has moved to https://github.com/cadorn/domplate

The Domplate template system provides an advanced javascript template system taken and modified from Firebug.

Features:

  * Templates are assembled via function calls instead of strings
  * User-defined callbacks to iterate and format data
  * Object oriented design allows for advanced hierarchies

This project aims to enable domplate for general use in all browsers and to provide detailed documentation.

You can find a modified version of domplete with added logging capabilities for debugging [here](http://code.google.com/p/domplate/source/browse/trunk/libraries/domplate/domplate-debug.js). See [here](http://www.christophdorn.com/Blog/2008/09/07/domplate-debug-logging/) for more information on how to use it.
